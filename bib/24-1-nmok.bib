  abstract = {This article argues that search engines, algorithms, and databases can be considered as a way of understanding deep mediatization. They are embedded in a variety of social and cultural practices, and as such, they change our communicative actions to be shaped by their logic of archiving, ordering, and searching. I argue that, increasingly and in particular ways, search engines, algorithms, and databases shape our everyday communicative actions as they make us think, internalize, and act along the lines of their particular modes of communication action. After having briefly reviewed recent trends in mediatization research, the argument is discussed and unfolded in between the material and social constructivist-phenomenological interpretations of mediatization. In conclusion, it is discussed how deep this form of mediatization can be taken to be.},

  abstract = {The video-sharing social media platform TikTok has experienced a rapid rise in use since its release in 2016. While its popularity is undeniable, at the first glance, it seems to offer features already available on previously existing and well-established platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook. To understand processes of self-making on TikTok, we undertake two methods of data collection: a walkthrough of the app and its surrounding environment, and 14 semistructured participant interviews. A qualitative analysis of this data finds three distinct themes emerge: (1) awareness of the algorithm, (2) content without context, and (3) self-creation across platforms. These results show that TikTok departs from existing platforms in the model of self-making it engenders, which we term “the algorithmized self”—a complication of the pre-existing “networked self” framework.},

  abstract = {This article investigates the logics that underpin music curation, and particularly the work of music curators, working at digital music streaming platforms. Based on ethnographic research that combines participant observation and a set of interviews with key informants, the article questions the relationship between algorithmic and human curation and the specific workings of music curation as a form of platform gatekeeping. We argue that music streaming platforms in combining proprietary algorithms and human curators constitute the ?new gatekeepers? in an industry previously dominated by human intermediaries such as radio programmers, journalists, and other experts. The article suggests understanding this gatekeeping activity as a form of ?algo-torial power? that has the ability to set the ?listening agendas? of global music consumers. While the power of traditional gatekeepers was mainly of an editorial nature, albeit data had some relevance in orienting their choices, the power of platform gatekepeers is an editorial power ?augmented? and enhanced by algorithms and big data. Platform gatekeepers have more data, more tools to manage and to make sense of these data, and thus more power than their predecessors. Platformization of music curation then consists of a data-intense gatekeeping activity, based on different mixes of algo-torial logics, that produces new regimes of visibility. This makes the platform capitalistic model potentially more efficient than industrial capitalism in transforming audience attention into data and data into commodities.},

To help answer these questions, this article examines people’s personal stories about the Facebook algorithm through tweets and interviews with 25 ordinary users. To understand the spaces where people and algorithms meet, this article develops the notion of the algorithmic imaginary. It is argued that the algorithmic imaginary – ways of thinking about what algorithms are, what they should be and how they function – is not just productive of different moods and sensations but plays a generative role in moulding the Facebook algorithm itself. Examining how algorithms make people feel, then, seems crucial if we want to understand their social power.},

  abstract = {Autonomy has been central to moral and political philosophy for millennia, and has been positioned as a critical aspect of both justice and wellbeing. Research in psychology supports this position, providing empirical evidence that autonomy is critical to motivation, personal growth and psychological wellness. Responsible AI will require an understanding of, and ability to effectively design for, human autonomy (rather than just machine autonomy) if it is to genuinely benefit humanity. Yet the effects on human autonomy of digital experiences are neither straightforward nor consistent, and are complicated by commercial interests and tensions around compulsive overuse. This multi-layered reality requires an analysis that is itself multidimensional and that takes into account human experience at various levels of resolution. We borrow from HCI and psychological research to apply a model (“METUX”) that identifies six distinct spheres of technology experience. We demonstrate the value of the model for understanding human autonomy in a technology ethics context at multiple levels by applying it to the real-world case study of an AI-enhanced video recommender system. In the process we argue for the following three claims: (1) There are autonomy-related consequences to algorithms representing the interests of third parties, and they are not impartial and rational extensions of the self, as is often perceived; (2) Designing for autonomy is an ethical imperative critical to the future design of responsible AI; and (3) Autonomy-support must be analysed from at least six spheres of experience in order to appropriately capture contradictory and downstream effects.},

At the same time, media users are faced with a lack of control and transparency when interacting with these systems because algorithms largely remain black boxes to end users. Relying on the notion that algorithms are socio-technical systems that comprise both technical and human components, this paper examines internet users’ awareness of algorithms in different areas of internet use and inquires into users’ perceptions of the impact of algorithms on their autonomy when interacting online. Empirically, we rely on qualitative interviews with 30 German internet users. Findings indicate that users in general are aware of algorithms operating in a wide range of applications and demonstrate a basic understanding of how these systems work. In line with the third-person effect, users perceive algorithms to have a stronger impact on others’ internet use than on their own. Further, users’ awareness of algorithms was found to be closely related to their perceived autonomy. When users feel in control of their interactions online, they are less aware of the impact of algorithms governing their interactions. Based on these results, we discuss the implications for transparency measures in algorithm regulation.},

Arguably, this technological development has far-reaching consequences for individuals and societies alike. In this article, we propose a psychological model of the effects of personalization in digital environments, which connects personalization with motivational tendencies, psychological needs, and well-being. Based on the model, we review studies from three areas of application?news feeds and websites, music streaming, and online dating?to explain both the positive and the negative effects of personalization on individuals. We conclude that personalization can lead to desirable outcomes such as reducing choice overload. However, personalized digital environments without transparency and without the option for users to play an active role in the personalization process potentially pose a danger to human well-being. Design recommendations as well as avenues for future research that follow from these conclusions are being discussed.},

AI-powered social media use and its outcomes largely depend on how users collaborate with AI that exercises agency. Through in-depth interviews with TikTok users, this study investigates how users collaborate with AI when using AI-powered social media and how such dynamics shape user engagement. We found that TikTok users are receptive to personalized experiences enabled by machine agency. However, by influencing each other, user agency and machine agency also led to user–AI synergy. Users deliberately influence content curation algorithms to make them cater more precisely to their needs; AI also facilitates users’ content creation and networking. Such AI–user collaboration on TikTok significantly influences medium engagement and social-interactive engagement. These findings advance our understanding of the dynamics between human agency and machine agency and, thus, how AI transforms user experiences on social media.Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has now been widely applied to social media. AI arranges posts based on user preferences and helps users easily create and share social media posts. AI-based algorithms underlying social media make decisions and initiate actions when interacting with human users, suggesting that machine agency and human agency coexist in human–machine interactions on AI-based social media. This study explores how TikTok users collaborate with AI, specifically focusing on the dynamics between human agency and machine agency, and how such dynamics shape user engagement. In-depth interviews with 25 TikTok users indicate that users are largely receptive to the personalized experiences offered by AI-enabled algorithms. Human users and AI-based algorithms also influence each other when the two interact, leading to human–AI synergy effects. Users try to train algorithms to provide a personalized feed that caters to their interests more precisely.

The current contribution elaborates on the causes and manifestations of meaningfulness and argues that resonances between entertainment content (characters, situations, decisions, or metaphors) and audience members’ biographic memories—particular recollections of critical life incidents or life crisis—generate experiences of meaning. Such biographic resonance is suggested to cause eudaimonic entertainment, specifically mixed-affect experiences that combine negative feelings associated with the audience member’s past or current life crisis with hope and other-praising emotions that emerge from the inspiration and advice obtained from the entertainment message. This chapter formalizes biographic resonance theory as postulated interaction of message attributes and audience members’ biographies and develop programmatic perspectives on theory extensions and testing as well as implications for entertainment effects on human well-being at the population level.},

Using qualitative methods, we analyzed 24 interviews with TikTok users to explore how algorithmic personalization processes inform people’s understanding of their identities as well as shape their orientation to others. Building on insights from our qualitative data and previous scholarship on algorithms and identity, we propose a novel conceptual model to understand how people think about and interact with personalized algorithmic systems. Drawing on the metaphor of crystals and their properties, the algorithmic crystal framework is an analytic frame that captures user understandings of how personalized algorithms (1) interact with user identity by reflecting user self-concepts that are both multifaceted and dynamic and (2) shape perspectives on others encountered through the algorithm, by orienting users to recognize parts of themselves refracted in other users and to experience ephemeral, diffracted connections with groups of similar others. We describe how the algorithmic crystal framework can extend theory and inform new lines of research around the implications of algorithms in self-concept development and social life.

This feature has been criticized for limiting users’ exposure to a range of diverse media content and information sources; meanwhile, YouTube has reported that they have implemented various technical and policy changes to address these concerns. However, there is little publicly available data to support either the existing concerns or YouTube’s claims of having addressed them. Drawing on the idea of “platform observability,” this article combines computational and qualitative methods to investigate the types of content that the algorithms underpinning YouTube’s “up next” feature amplify over time, using three keyword search terms associated with sociocultural issues where concerns have been raised about YouTube’s role: “coronavirus,” “feminism,” and “beauty.” Over six weeks, we collected the videos (and their metadata, including channel IDs) that were highly ranked in the search results for each keyword, as well as the highly ranked recommendations associated with the videos. We repeated this exercise for three steps in the recommendation chain and then examined patterns in the recommended videos (and the channels that uploaded the videos) for each query and their variation over time. We found evidence of YouTube’s stated efforts to boost “authoritative” media outlets, but at the same time, misleading and controversial content continues to be recommended. We also found that while algorithmic recommendations offer diversity in videos over time, there are clear “winners” at the channel level that are given a visibility boost in YouTube’s “up next” feature. However, these impacts are attenuated differently depending on the nature of the issue.},

Research on this topic has accumulated rapidly, accompanied by controversial public debate and numerous systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Yet, a higher-level integration of the multiple disparate conceptual and operational approaches to CMC and MH and individual review findings is desperately needed. To this end, we first develop two organizing frameworks that systematize conceptual and operational approaches to CMC and MH. Based on these frameworks, we integrate the literature through a meta-review of 34 reviews and a content analysis of 594 publications. Meta-analytic evidence, overall, suggests a small negative association between social media use and MH. However, effects are complex and depend on the CMC and MH indicators investigated. Based on our conceptual review and the evidence synthesis, we devise an agenda for future research in this interdisciplinary field.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Recent approaches in entertainment research have extended the scope from hedonic gratifications (fun, suspense) to meaningful and thought-provoking entertainment experiences (appreciation). The present research examines the cross-national measurement validity of these theoretical constructs by testing the factorial structure of the German version of the Appreciation, Fun, and Suspense scales developed by Oliver and Bartsch (2010) . Measurement invariance of the scales across US-American ( N = 262) and German ( N = 274) samples is examined by reanalyzing data sets from two published studies. Findings support the theoretically assumed three-factorial model of the German scale and partial scalar invariance across samples. In addition, exploratory analyses of a third data set ( N = 200) revealed that an alternative wording for an item of the Suspense scale may be superior.},

  abstract = {Advances in personalization algorithms and other applications of machine learning have vastly enhanced the ease and convenience of our media and communication experiences, but they have also raised significant concerns about privacy, transparency of technologies and human control over their operations. Going forth, reconciling such tensions between machine agency and human agency will be important in the era of artificial intelligence (AI), as machines get more agentic and media experiences become increasingly determined by algorithms. Theory and research should be geared toward a deeper understanding of the human experience of algorithms in general and the psychology of Human–AI interaction (HAII) in particular. This article proposes some directions by applying the dual-process framework of the Theory of Interactive Media Effects (TIME) for studying the symbolic and enabling effects of the affordances of AI-driven media on user perceptions and experiences.},

  abstract = {The narrative enjoyment and appreciation rationale (NEAR) builds on dual-process logic to distinguish these two forms of audience response to media entertainment shaped by either an intuitive or deliberative processing system. Three message features are critical in determining how these systems govern response: (1) the absence or presence of intuition conflict in the narrative, (2) the extent to which different intuitions are made salient (i.e., emphasized in the plot), and (3) the satisfaction/thwarting of those salient intuitions, where satisfaction refers to reward for acts that conform to intuitions, and thwarting refers to the inverse of this. When               all               salient intuitive needs are satisfied by entertainment experience, positive affect produced by intuitive processes is labeled               enjoyment               . By comparison, when the entertainment experience satisfies               the most salient               intuitive needs, but               not all salient               intuitive needs, positive affect produced by deliberative processing is labeled               appreciation               .},

  abstract = {Human–algorithm interaction has emerged as a pressing area in social media research because algorithms curate and govern most communication on social media. In the present study, we focus on the perceptions people have of algorithms as it relates to their identity and goals. Bridging interpersonal communication theory into human–algorithm interactions, we explicate the concepts of perceived algorithm responsiveness (PAR) and perceived algorithm insensitivity (PAI). In two preregistered studies, we examine PAR and PAI across the social media ecology, finding that TikTok has a higher PAR and lower PAI compared with Facebook and Instagram. Data suggest that algorithm awareness is only weakly correlated with PAR or PAI, and that PAR was a significant predictor of people’s social media enjoyment. These results contribute to research on human–algorithm interaction by conceptualizing and testing two new theoretical concepts to explain the algorithm responsiveness process.},

Building on established theoretical concerns and the research possibilities enabled by large social datasets, we propose a framework for mapping information exposure of digitally situated individuals. We argue that from the perspective of an individual’s personal communication network, comparable processes of “curation” are undertaken by a variety of actors—not only conventional newsmakers but also individual media users, social contacts, advertisers, and computer algorithms. Detecting the competition, intersection, and overlap of these flows is crucial to understanding media exposure and effects today. Our approach reframes research questions in debates such as polarization, selective and incidental exposure, participation, and conceptual orientations for computational approaches.},

Departing from a brief review of ancient roots and twentieth-century pioneer works, we elaborate on the state and challenges of contemporary entertainment theory and research. This includes the need to develop a more explicit understanding of interrelationships among similar terms and concepts (e.g., “presence” and “transportation”), the need to reflect more explicitly on epistemological foundations of entertainment theories (e.g., neobehaviorism), and the need to reach back to past, even historical reasoning in communication that may be just as informative as the consideration of recent theoretical innovations from neighboring fields such as social psychology. Finally, we offer some reflections on programmatic perspectives for future entertainment theory, which should try to harmonize views from the social sciences and critical thinking, span cultural differences in entertainment processes, and keep track of the rapid technological progress of entertainment media.},

In the background of four identified fundamental assumptions in entertainment theory (entertainment as reception phenomenon, disparity between what media users want and what they should want, entertainment between approaching and avoiding affective states, entertainment as self-transcendence) media experiences are dichotomized between those that serve users’ hedonic motivations, needs, and interests and others, more fundamental experiences of resonance (which in the recent past have often been labeled eudaimonic) that connect users to the content of a media narrative and ultimately changes them. The argument is made here for communication scholars and media psychologists to refer to entertainment experiences only in the first case in order to be less vague and ambiguous in explicating entertainment theory.},
